Test recommendations with resource previews to check persona fit, and analyze potential biases across diverse personas.\n","\n","**Instructions**:\n","1. Discuss: Who is your user? (e.g., “Sam, 30, prefers visual science resources for self-study”).\n","2. Write persona and vision in a Google Slides template (provided).\n","3. Test 2 topic/learning style combinations in the recommendation section for this persona, noting previews.\n","4. Create a second persona with different cultural or learning preferences (e.g., someone who prefers auditory resources or non-Western content). Test the same 2 topic/learning style combinations for this second persona.\n","5. Analyze the recommendations for both personas: Are certain types of resources (e.g., Western-authored, books) over-recommended? What might cause these differences (e.g., dataset bias)?\n","6. Save outputs (text, previews) to Slides, including your bias analysis.\n","\n","**Challenge**: Balancing niche (e.g., auditory resources) vs. broad preferences to ensure enough matches.\n","\n","**Discussion Questions**:\n","- Are your persona’s preferences too specific, risking few matches?\n","- How do resource previews influence the persona’s engagement?\n","- How did the recommendations differ between the two personas? Were certain types of resources (e.g., Western-authored, books) over-recommended?\n","- What might cause these differences (e.g., dataset bias, limited topic/learning style options)? How could the system be improved to ensure fairness across diverse preferences?\n","\n","**Competition**: present a 3-5 min pitch of your persona’s backstory, including your bias analysis, and submit via Teams (10 points, instructor/AI-judged)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"day2"},"source":["## Day 2: Design Recommendation Logic\n","\n","**Task**: Define how EduResource selects resources (e.g., prioritize topic over learning style). Compare recommendations with previews for 3 inputs to justify your logic, and evaluate the diversity of recommendations.\n","\n","**Instructions**:\n","1. Discuss: Should topic or learning style weigh more? (e.g., “Topic 70%, learning style 30%”). Use the sliders in the recommendation section to adjust weights.\n","2. Write your recommendation logic in a Slides template.\n","3. Test 3 topic/learning style combinations in the recommendation section.\n","4. Analyze the diversity of the recommended resources (e.g., count how many are books vs. videos, or Western vs. non-Western authors).\n","5. Adjust the topic/learning style weights (e.g., 90%/10% vs. 50%/50%) and re-test one combination. How do the weights impact diversity?\n","6. Save outputs (text, previews) and explain why your logic supports your persona’s needs, including your diversity analysis.\n","\n","**Challenge**: Handling sparse data (e.g., few “Auditory” resources).\n","\n","**Discussion Questions**:\n","- What fallback topics work if your preferred topic is missing?\n","- How do previews enhance your logic’s effectiveness?\n","- How did the topic/learning style weights affect the diversity of recommendations? Did higher topic weights lead to more homogeneous recommendations?\n","- What are the implications of prioritizing topic over learning style (or vice versa) for users with niche preferences? Could this lead to exclusion of certain resource types or cultures?\n","\n","**Competition**: present a 3-5 min pitch about your unique recommendation rule, including your diversity analysis submit your slides via Teams (10 points, instructor/AI-judged)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"day3"},"source":["## Day 3: Create UI Mockup and Test Recommendations\n","\n","**Task**: Design a web app mockup in Canva, specifying how recommendations and previews are displayed (e.g., list with filters). Generate recommendations with previews for the mockup, and design UI elements to promote transparency and diversity.\n","\n","**Instructions**:\n","1. Discuss: What UI elements make EduResource intuitive? (e.g., resource thumbnails, filters).\n","2. Create a mockup using a Canva template (provided). Include a feature to display the diversity of recommendations (e.g., a breakdown of resource types/authors) and a transparency element (e.g., showing the topic/learning style weights used).\n","3. Generate 2 sets of recommendations with previews for your persona.\n","4. Discuss how these UI elements (diversity breakdown, transparency) might influence user perception and trust.\n","5. Save mockup and outputs (text, previews) to Slides, including your discussion on UI impact.\n","\n","**Challenge**: Making the UI engaging for diverse learners while showcasing metadata and previews.\n","\n","**Discussion Questions**:\n","- Should you use filters or sliders for topic/learning style?\n","- How do previews enhance the UI’s appeal?\n","- How might showing the diversity of recommendations (e.g., resource type breakdown) affect the user’s trust in the system?\n","- Does displaying the topic/learning style weights make the system more transparent?

Write 3 prompts in the explanation section, testing different tones.\n","3. Generate explanations, select the best 3, and save to Slides.\n","4.
