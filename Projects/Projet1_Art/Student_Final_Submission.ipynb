    "\n",
    "**Instructions**: Summarize your work over the week into a detailed pipeline for your recommendation system, focusing on your two personas. This submission will be evaluated based on how well your system meets the needs of your personas and aligns with the principles of recommendation system design. Provide clear, concise answers for each section below. Your submission should be 500–700 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Persona Descriptions\n",
    "Provide detailed profiles for your two personas, including:\n",
    "- Name, age, and background.\n",
    "- Art preferences (e.g., specific styles like \"Oil Painting,\" moods like \"calm,\" cultural preferences like \"non-Western art\").\n",
    "- Needs and goals (e.g., seeking inspiration, relaxation).\n",
    "- Example: \"Persona 1: Luna, 28, a graphic designer who loves abstract art with an energetic mood to inspire her creative projects. She needs vibrant, dynamic artworks to spark ideas.\"\n",

    "- Justification for these weights: How do they meet the personas’ preferences?\n",
    "- Example: \"We used 70% style (Oil Painting) and 30% mood (energetic) for Luna because her preference for abstract art is more style-driven, ensuring vibrant artworks are prioritized.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "- The artwork title, style/mood combination used, and the explanation.\n",
    "- How the explanation addresses the persona’s preferences and any biases (e.g., cultural bias).\n",
    "- Example: \"For Luna: 'The Starry Night' (Oil Painting, energetic). Explanation: 'The Starry Night' by Vincent van Gogh aligns with your energetic preference through its vibrant swirls and bold colors, recommended with a 70% style weight. We ensured the explanation highlights non-Western alternatives to address cultural bias.'\"\n",
